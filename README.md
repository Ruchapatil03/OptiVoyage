# OptiVoyage‚öì  
Vessel Performance Optimization | Fuel efficiency, safety, and speed: all in one.

</div>

## Overview üîé

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences  
**Department:** Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)  
**Problem Statement: 1658** - Development of a versatile and fast algorithm for optimal ship routing.  
**Theme:** Transportation & Logistics  

VIPIO aims to optimize vessel performance by improving fuel efficiency, ensuring safety, and maintaining speed. This project focuses on developing a robust and versatile algorithm for optimal ship routing.


## Features ‚≠ê

1. **Fuel Efficiency:** Optimizes fuel consumption by analyzing and selecting the most efficient routes. The system considers various factors such as vessel speed, fuel consumption rates, and ocean currents to minimize fuel usage, leading to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

2. **Safety:** Incorporates comprehensive safety measures by evaluating weather patterns, ocean conditions, and potential hazards. The system provides recommendations to avoid dangerous areas, ensuring safe navigation and reducing the risk of accidents or delays.

3. **Speed Optimization:** Balances vessel speed with fuel efficiency to achieve optimal performance. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the vessel's speed based on current conditions and route efficiency, ensuring timely arrivals while minimizing fuel consumption.

4. **Versatility:** Adapts to different types of vessels and a wide range of ocean conditions. Whether it's a cargo ship, tanker, or recreational boat, VIPIO can tailor its recommendations to the specific characteristics and requirements of each vessel.

5. **User-Friendly System:** Features an intuitive interface designed for ease of use. Users can easily input parameters, view recommendations, and monitor vessel performance without needing advanced technical knowledge.

6. **Dynamic Route Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the vessel‚Äôs route and provides updates based on changing conditions. The system alerts users to any significant deviations or new hazards, allowing for proactive route adjustments.

7. **Route Alerts:** Sends notifications and alerts about critical route changes, weather updates, or potential hazards. These alerts help users make informed decisions and take immediate action if necessary.

8. **Support:** Offers comprehensive support to users, including troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and contact information for further assistance. Users can access help resources to resolve any issues or questions they may have about the system.

9. **Post-Voyage Assessment Reports:** Generates detailed reports after each voyage, summarizing performance metrics, fuel consumption, route efficiency, and any incidents. These reports provide valuable insights for future voyages and help users improve their routing strategies.

## Developer Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To run this project locally, clone this repository by running the command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ruchapatil03/OptiVoyage
```

Once successfully cloned, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests xarray numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run the Backend Server:**
   Navigate to the `backend` directory of the project and start the server. Typically, this involves running a script or using a command such as:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This should start the execution of the development server.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Navigate to the `app` directory and install the necessary dependencies using:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend Server:**
   Start the frontend development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the frontend application, typically available at `http://localhost:5173` or another port specified in the configuration.
